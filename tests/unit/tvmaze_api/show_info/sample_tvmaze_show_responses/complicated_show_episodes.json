He delightedly examines his new appearance (noting he has a slight weakness in his right wrist's dorsal tubercle, a full head of hair, sideburns, is slimmer, and has a mole between his shoulder blades), while asking her what she thinks of the way he looks.</p><p>Rose, confused and frightened, asks him who he is. When he tells her he is the Doctor, she does not believe him. Confused as to what she has just seen, she theorises that this stranger has replaced the Doctor by means of teleportation, or perhaps he is a Slitheen. She demands that he bring the Doctor back, and the Doctor tries to reassure her that it is him, telling her how they first met in the cellar at Henrik's, and the first word he ever said to her was \"run\".</p><p>Rose starts to believe him, and the Doctor leaps around the console happily, reminiscing about their other adventures, such as when they once had to hop for their lives. However, she is still unsettled and asks him if he can change back to his previous self. A deflated Doctor replies that he cannot, and asks her if she wants to leave. When Rose hesitates in her answer, he resets the TARDIS' coordinates for her council estate on Christmas Eve, offering her the choice to stay with her mother, Jackie, or continue her travels with him.</p><p>Suddenly, the Doctor suffers a form of seizure, expelling glowing energy from his mouth, and the TARDIS shudders as if in sympathetic response. The Doctor tells Rose that the regeneration is going wrong and starts to act maniacally, throwing switches on the TARDIS console and ranting about increasing speed, as the sounds of the Cloister Bell start ringing through the console room. As Rose hangs on to the console for dear life, the TARDIS heads for a crash landing on Christmas Eve.</p><p> </p>",

While this was made before the filming of <i>The Pilot</i>, which introduced Bill to the show proper, some elements were re-used and re-purposed for that episode. In the new scene, Bill and the Doctor are in a Dalek-Movellan war zone, where they have fled to free themselves from some sentient oil, the main antagonist of that story. The story is also technically the first appearance of Heather, as the Dalek shown at the end of this story was later revealed to be the oil in disguise.</p><p>The Twelfth Doctor and Bill Potts are running from this Dalek. They hide behind a wall, and Bill repeatedly questions the Doctor as to what a Dalek is. Bill mentions the Daleks' standard weapons and their standard catchphrase. The Doctor tells Bill what a Dalek is. He hurriedly explains to her, then they run away, intent on going back to the TARDIS, convinced that 2017 needs them. However, they are cornered by the Dalek.</p><p>As they turn around a text hits the screen that says \"Introducing Pearl Mackie as Bill\".</p>",

The Doctor approaches the portal, linking the TARDIS to the Doctor Who Prom at the Royal Albert Hall.

Amy insists that it's an obvious signal, telling her to \"Get your coat, love, the Doctor's in.\"</p><p>The Doctor hurriedly explains he didn't bring her with him because he found her attractive. He proudly insists that he's like Gandalf in space. Amy says he acts like a regular bloke, showing off for the girls and laughing at other guys, making fun of Rory's nose.</p><p>The Doctor tells Amy that he can't \"see it\" any more. He's made time and space his back yard for over nine hundred years, so everything about it is now just facts to him. But Amy can \"see it\", which lets the Doctor see it as well. That is his only reason. Amy wonders if there have been others before her.</p><p>The Doctor reluctantly admits that he's had \"a few\" companions, but Amy won't let go. She wonders how many were girls. The Doctor admits girls made up \"a bit over half\" of his companions. Amy tricks the Doctor into accessing the TARDIS' visual records. To his dismay, the TARDIS plays black and white visual records on the screen of many female companions — leaving out the men, K9, and Kamelion — from Barbara Wright to Donna Noble, in random order. Amy wonders about one of the Fourth Doctor's companions, Leela. She appears repeatedly in a leather bikini.</p><p>Embarrassed, the Doctor decides to collect Rory to have Amy focus on her life. Amy informs him Rory is having his bachelor party. With a smirk, the Doctor tells her, \"Well, let's make it a great one\" before starting up the TARDIS and flying to the early evening of 25 June 2010.</p>",

As he chastises her, she notices the gold dress he chose for their first visit to Caldoron Beta five years before, hanging near the console. This incarnation of River is wearing the vortex manipulator, placing the events after \"The Pandorica Opens\"/\"The Big Bang\" from her perspective. She demands to know whom he's brought, and storms up the stairs to find the hussy. An instant later, the first River returns from the TARDIS wardrobe, demanding to know whom the Doctor talking to; she returns to the wardrobe. The second River returns, demanding to know to whom the Doctor is speaking. When he denies talking to anyone, she resumes her hunt. A third River enters the TARDIS, actually wearing the gold dress. This version of River was expecting to meet the Doctor here, but on seeing an identical gold dress hung by the console, asks why he has bought another. The Doctor asks her to step outside to check if the light on top of the TARDIS is working.</p><p>The youngest River reappears, certain she has heard voices. The Doctor tells her he was talking to himself and she bustles off again. The second River returns to the control room, likewise convinced she heard the Doctor talking to someone. The Doctor brusquely activates her vortex manipulator to send her back to prison. The third River re-enters the TARDIS, followed by a second, older version of the Eleventh Doctor, who informs her that she is in the wrong TARDIS. As they are about to leave, she tells the younger Doctor that they are off to see the Singing Towers of Darillium. The two Doctors share a brief, sad moment, knowing such a trip would possibly be the most advanced (in total age) Doctor she would see before she dies in the Library (\"Forest of the Dead\") in the Tenth Doctor's presence.</p><p>As the older Doctor leaves, the youngest River returns to catch a glimpse of the Doctors together. She asks the younger Doctor about it but he refuses to tell her, using River's catchphrase, \"Spoilers\". River jokes that his secrets will be the death of her and walks past him.
